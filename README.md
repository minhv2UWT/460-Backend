# Branch Strategy

When working on a new feature create a new branch like this ``` git checkout -b <branch-name> ```.
This will ensure that we run into minimal issues when pushing changes to the main branch.

VS Code provides a very useful interface for pushing code. It takes away the command line and simplifies it to 
some button clicks. After you checkout a branch and are ready to commit the code. You will need to commit the code with a commit message and then publish the branch. This will publish your branch to the main repo. Once you see the branch available you can create a Pull Request from you branch in to ``` main ```.
